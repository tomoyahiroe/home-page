By building this visualization site, we hope to:\n\nBridge the Gap: Translate complex economic theories into visual realities that are easier to grasp.\n\nEmpower Educators: Simplify lesson prep by allowing professors to easily export high-quality visuals for their slides and lectures.\n\nPromote Open Learning: For every graph we create, we provide the Python code used to generate it. This allows students to not only see the data but also learn the programming logic behind the visualization.","type":"content","url":"/blog/2026/web-dev-ynu#why-this-matters","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Our On-going Project Featured on YNU’s Homepage","lvl2":"The Journey So Far"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/blog/2026/web-dev-ynu#the-journey-so-far","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Our On-going Project Featured on YNU’s Homepage","lvl2":"The Journey So Far"},"content":"Working alongside my professor and a talented team of colleagues has been an incredible learning experience.
